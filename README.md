# INDP

(This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.6.)

INDP stands for "Interslavic Noun Declension Practice". It was created for learners of the Interslavic (ISV) language, so that they can have a special place to practice cases and noun declension. This is useful for speakers of languages without cases or with fewer cases than ISV, as well as to clear up ambiguities of case uses between slavic languages (for example, in one scenario, Russian may use the dative, but Polish - the accusative).

## Development server

Run `npm run start` or `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `npm run start-open` to run a dev server on your local IP (WARNING: this may pose security vulnerabilities to your network), which allows connections from, for example, another device, different from the host, like a phone -- for testing adaptive design.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component, `ng generate service` for a service. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `docs/` directory.

In the current workflow, the project should only be built to the `gh-pages` branch. I'm thinking to change this workflow soon, but if you are reading this, then it's still this way.


## Tests

Tests are not currently configured but these are the commends for them:

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.


## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

If you need more help on the project, for now the only way to reach me is to create an issue. Also check the discussions here on GitHub.
