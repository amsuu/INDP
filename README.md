# INDP

(This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.6.)

(subsequently updated to 18.1.0... badly ...see [d296350](https://github.com/amsuu/INDP/commit/d296350))

INDP stands for "Interslavic Noun Declension Practice". It was created for learners of the Interslavic (ISV) language, so that they can have a special place to practice cases and noun declension. This is useful for speakers of languages without cases or with fewer cases than ISV, as well as to clear up ambiguities of case uses between slavic languages (for example, in one scenario, Russian may use the dative, but Polish - the accusative).

For more information on the Interslavic language, visit [http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/history.html](http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/history.html)

# Getting started (for users)

The project isn't fully finished yet, but to have a play around with the bits that are working, go to [https://amsuu.github.io/INDP](https://amsuu.github.io/INDP).

# Getting started (for developers)

## Prerequisites
- A fairly new LTS version of [**NodeJS**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and NPM (Node Package Manager). _(Node Version Manager or [**NVM**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/) is also [reccomended for installing them](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) but not required)_
- [**Git CLI**](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git), or any way to execute git commands from your machine.
- Angular CLI installed via NPM _(If not installed by following the below instructions)_
- All others will be installed by NPM from the file `package.json`

## Setting up development enviroment

- Make a fork of the repo

_(If you're new to Git/GitHub, read the [**"Contributing to a Project" Guide**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project) by GitHub, for the generally reccomended Git workflow)_

### Using terminal (untested)

Enter inside the directory in which you want the project folder to be
```console
cd {dir of your choice}
```

After forking the repo, clone your fork using Git CLI, and enter the folder: _(Replacing `{Your Name}` with your github username)_
```console
git clone https://github.com/{Your Name}/INDP
cd INDP
```

Create a branch to work on: _(Replacing {Branch Name} with a name of your choice, the **same name** in both cases)_
```console
git branch {Branch Name}
git checkout {Branch Name}
```

Finally install the packages required by the repo using NPM. The main ones that will be installed are Angular, Angular CLI, Typescript, and SASS.
```console
npm install
```
_(Note to self: the other packages, which are not related to angular core etc., but are still installed, are a result of my debugging and should really be cleaned up.)_

### Using VSCode Source control (untested)

- After forking the repo, clone your fork repository at link `https://github.com/{YOUR NAME}/INDP` following [this guide by microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/javascript/how-to/with-visual-studio-code/clone-github-repository?tabs=activity-bar).

- After that, [create a branch to work on](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/javascript/how-to/with-visual-studio-code/clone-github-repository?tabs=activity-bar#create-a-branch-for-changes) (same guide).

- Then, a simple `npm install` command in the integrated terminal to install the dependencies should be enough.


## Development server

Run `npm run start` or `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `npm run start-open` to run a dev server on your local IP **(WARNING: this may pose security vulnerabilities to your network as outlined in the warning when running the command, generated by Angular)**, which allows connections from, for example, another device, different from the host, like a phone -- for testing adaptive design.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component, `ng generate service` for a service. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Contributing your changes
After making all your [changes, staging, commiting, pushing,](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project) make a pull request and me or somebody else will review it.


## Building

In the current workflow, the project should only be built to the `gh-pages` branch. I'm thinking to change this workflow soon, but if you are reading this, then it's still this way.

Run `npm run build` to build the project. (DON'T run `ng build` unless you know what you're doing, or running the exact script which is under under the hood when you run "`npm run build`", the build URL has to be very specific or else everything breaks for some reason :/) The build artifacts will be stored in the `docs/` directory.

To sync changes with master simply do
```terminal
git checkout gh-pages
git merge master
git push origin gh-pages
```
Github Pages should automatically update the deployment after a while.

## Tests (not implemented)

Tests are not currently configured but these are the commands for them:

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.


## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

If you need more help on the project, for now the only way to reach me is to create an issue. Also check the "discussions" here on GitHub.
