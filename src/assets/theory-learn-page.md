# Cases
## What are cases?

In most Slavic languages, alongside with grammatical gender (like in
languages such as German and Spanish) and grammatical number (which
you are surely familiar with), there is a declension category called a
“Case.” These cases help communicate the
<app-phrase-with-more-info phrase="syntactical role">
</app-phrase-with-more-info>
of any given word in a given sentence.

<app-phrase-explaination explaination
="The syntactical role expresses how a word in a sentence relates to
the others with regards to the action. Basically stuff like the subject
and object of a sentence. And if you don't know what that is, the
subject is the one who is performing the action (the verb), and the
object is the one recieving it. In Slavic languages, this idea extends to
posession, location, and even method/instrument as you'll read futher."
></app-phrase-explaination>

And a lot of the times when there is a
<app-phrase-with-more-info phrase="preposition"></app-phrase-with-more-info>
before a word, the word takes a special case. As you'll see in the
<a routerLink="learn/theory#prepositions">Prepositions</a> section.
<strong class="note">
    (Don't go there yet! You still need to understand cases.)
</strong>


<app-phrase-explaination explaination
="Prepositions are words like english “to” “from” “towards” “on”
“with” “at” “on” “in” and so on."
></app-phrase-explaination>

## Nominative

The default case. It is used in the dictionary form 
_(“lemma form”)_ of words and when the word in question
is the <app-phrase-with-more-info phrase="subject of a sentence">
</app-phrase-with-more-info>.


## Accusative

This is the case of the <app-phrase-with-more-info phrase="direct object">
</app-phrase-with-more-info>. It is used when the word in question is
the direct recipient of the action.


## Dative

Dative is the case of the <app-phrase-with-more-info phrase="indirect object">
</app-phrase-with-more-info>. **To** whom the action is being
commited. The most common example is with phrases relating to giving
something **to** someone.

### And here is where I answer the last three question marks. <br> Pay attention. This is key to understanding syntactical function:


Take the English example <u>“I gave the book to my friend.”</u>


Here,

<br>

_“I”_ is the **_subject_**
_NOTE: (the person who is doing the giving)_,

<br>

_“the book”_ is the **_direct object_**
_NOTE: (the thing being given)_, and

<br>

_“my friend”_ is the **_indirect object_**
_NOTE: (the person, **_to whom_** the book is being given)_.


Therefore,
<br>
_“I”_ would take the <u>**Nominative**</u>,
<br>
_“the book”_ would take the <u style="text-decoration: double underline;">**Accusative**</u>, and
<br>
_“my friend”_ would take the <u style="text-decoration: wavy underline;">**Dative**</u>.

**“<u>I</u> gave <u style="text-decoration: double underline;">the book</u>&nbsp;<u style="text-decoration: wavy underline;">to my friend</u>”**
**“<u>Ja</u> dah <u style="text-decoration: double underline;">knigų</u>&nbsp;<u style="text-decoration: wavy underline;">prijatelju</u>.”**

## Genitive

The genitive case is commonly used to show posession. It gets
applied to the posessor rather than than the posessed, similar
to the English “'s” suffix.


Another way to think about it (which
will be helpful later) is as equivilant or corresponding to the
English word “of”. As in “the book of knowledge” or “the Cliffs
of Dover”. Remember this. I'll even put an interesting icon here
so that you can remember this later:
<span class="material-symbols-rounded">table_lamp</span>


## Locative

The locative case shows a location (metaphorical or literal). For
example:

“**Ja jesm v <u>domu</u>**”
“**I am at <u>home</u>**”
or
“**V <u>lětu</u> jesť siĺno goreče**”
“**In <u>summer</u> it's very hot**”

## Instrumental

Instrumental is typically used with the meaning of “with” in
English. Be it “alongside with” or “by means of”. Examples are:

“**Idem vškolų s <u>mojimi prijateljami</u> vśaky deń**”
“**I go to school with <u>my friends</u> every day**”
or
“**Udarjajų gvozd s <u>mlatkom</u>**”
“**I hit the nail with a <u>hammer</u>**”

## Vocative

Vocative is when you are calling to someone/something and
talking directly to them or wanting to grab their attention.
For example:
<br>
<br>
“**_Sine_**, prihodi malo!”
<br>
“**_Son_**, come for a bit!”
<br>
<br>
“Čemu jesi to sdělal, **_Dimitre_**?”
<br>
“Why did you do this, **_Dimitr_**?”
<br>
<br>
“**_Bože_** moj...”
<br>
_(Literally) _
“**_Oh_**, my **_God_**”



# Prepositions


## With Genitive

Prepositions are used, which imply movement away or out of a location.
<br>
_NOTE:
    (And really, that just happens to include the better part of all the prepositions
    in Interslavic.)
_

<ul style="columns: 2;">
    <li>**iz** – from, out of</li>
    <li>**iz-medžu** – from between</li>

    <li>**vměsto** – instead of</li>
    <li>**vslěd** – following, because of, as a result of</li>
</ul>


## With Accusative
Prepositions are used, which imply movement towards/into/through a location:
<ul>
    <li>**črěz, prěz** – through, across, via</li>
    <li>**po** – for (in pursuit of, to get something); for (the Xth time); up to</li>
    <li>**za** – for, because of, due to, in exchange for, in favour of, instead of</li>
</ul>


## With Dative

Prepositions, implying the _action_ is directed towards
something/someone
<br>
_(similarly to the meaning of the case itself)_
<br>
_NOTE:
    (And if you'll notice, most of the English translations
    end in “to” as well)
_

<ul>
    <li>**blagodare, dekujuči, hvala** – thanks to</li>
    <li>**k, ko** – to, towards (direction)</li>
    <li>**po** – according to, per, by, in the manner of; for ... each, for ... a piece 	protiv – against</li>
    <li>**soglasno, suglasno** – according to</li>
</ul>

## With Instrumental

Similar to the meaning of the case itself, the prepositions imply
a method or accompaniment.

<ul>
    <li>**s, so** – with, together with; by means of, using </li>
    <li>**ponad** – above, beyond</li>
</ul>

## With Locative
The Locative is used with the following prepositions:
<ul>
    <li>**o, ob** – about; concerning, regarding</li>
    <li>**po** – after, following; along(side); throughout, round, all over</li>
    <li>**pri** – near; during (rule of a king)</li>
</ul>

## With Accusative and Instrumental

There are five prepositions for place (and time) in Interslavic,
which can take either the Accusative or Instrumental case. Which
case is used depends on the meaning:


The Instrumental is used when the location is stable. For example:

_“Kot <u>spi</u> pod **stol**.”_
<br>
_“The cat <u>is sleeping</u> under **the table**.” (Instrumental)_

And the Accusative is used when there is an implied movement to or
from the location. Like:

_“Kot <u>poběgl</u> pod **stolom**.”_
<br>
_“The cat <u>fled to</u> under **the table**.” (Accusative)_

The prepositions are:

<ul style="columns: 2;">
    <li>**medžu** – between (place & time)</li>
    <li>**nad** – above, over, beyond</li>
    <li>**pod** – under</li>
    <li>**prěd** – before, in front of, ahead of (place & time), prior to, ago</li>
    <li>**za** – behind (place), after (time) </li>
</ul>

## With Accusative and Locative

The below two prepositions work the same way as the above, only that
(more logically) the Locative is used instead of the Instrumental
when the location is stable.

_“Kot spi **na stolu**”_
<br>
_“The cat is sleeping **on the table**” (Locative)_
<br>
<br>
_“Kot <u>poběgl</u> na **stol**”_
<br>
_“The cat <u>fled</u>&nbsp;**onto** the table” (Accusative)_

The prepositions are:

<ul style="columns: 2;">
    <li>**na** (+ Locative) – <u>on</u>, at</li>
	<li>**v, vo** (+ Locative) – <u>in</u>, within</li>
    <li>**na** (+ Accusative) – <u>onto</u>, unto</li>
	<li>**v, vo** (+ Accusative) – <u>into</u></li>
</ul>

## Prepositional constructions

These are not prepositions in and of themselves, but rather
constructions of words, usually requiring a special case (similarly
to prepositions), which are often used (and treated)
as a preposition.


To give a similar example in English: The phrases
“with regards to” or “with the help of”. They aren't prepositions,
but usually are treated as one singular block.

_NOTE:
    And if you think about it, those also require a special case in English,
    when it comes to pronouns:
    <br>
    “with regards to **him**”, not
    <br>
    “with regards to **he**”
_

And like before there are a couple of different case uses, depending
on the construction. (Don't worry, they all make sense). So let's
look through them:

### Genitive

These are once again, with the Genitive, _most_ of the constructions
in Interslavic.


Here the important thing to remember, to keep an intuition for the cases,
is the correspondance between the English “of” and the Interslavic Genitive
case. And once again, notice that most of the English translations end in “of”.

<ul style="columns: 2;">
    <li>**s izključenjem** – except, with the exception of</li>
    <li>**s pomočju** – with the help of</li>
    <li>**v imenu** – in the name of</li>
    <li>**v obličju** – in the face of</li>
    <li>**v smyslu** – in the sense of</li>
    <li>**v času** – during _(Lit. “In the hour of”)_</li>
    <li>**v těčenju** – during _(Lit. “In the flow of”)_</li>
    <li>**v vrěmenu** – during _(Lit. “In the time of”)_</li>
    <li>**čto se tyče** – regarding, with regard to</li>
    <li>**pod vodstvom** – under leadership of</li>
    <li>**na prěkor** – in defiance of</li>
    <li>**od strany** – by, on the part of</li>
    <li>**v ramah, v ramkah** – within the framework of, as a part of</li>
    <li>**v odrazlikě _od_** – unlike, in contrast to</li>
    <li>**v različju _od_** – unlike, in difference to</li>
    <li>**susedno _do_** – next to, neighbouring to</li>
</ul>

The last three have the Genitive simply because the last word
of the construction is a preposition requiring the Genitive. I've marked
this with **_italics_**.

### Accusative

Similarly, the following constructions are used with Accusative, simply
because of the ending preposition. This pattern holds for Dative and
Instrumental so I won't repeat it again in those places.

<ul>
    <li>**bez obzira _na_** – regardless</li>
    <li>**s obzirom _na_** – with regard to</li>
    <li>**v zaměn _za_** – instead of, in exchange for</li>
    <li>**ne gledajuči _na_** – disregarding, despite, in spite of, notwithstanding</li>
</ul>
### Dative
<ul>
    <li>**po odnošenju _k_** – regarding, with regard _to_</li>
    <li>**v odnošenju _k_** – regarding, with regard _to_</li>
    <li>**v protivnosti _k_** – unlike, in opposition _to_</li>
</ul>
### Instrumental
<ul>
    <li>**sgodno _s_** – conforming _with_</li>
    <li>**v svezi _s_** – in connection _with_</li>
</ul>
