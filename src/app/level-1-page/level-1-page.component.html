    <h1>Level 1</h1>
    <h2>Word → target case</h2>
    <p>
        Each question has three fields. In the first one
        you will be presented with your base word. In the second field
        there are the target case and number. And you must input your
        answer in the third field, which consist of the base word,
        declined/conjugated with respect to the information given to you in
        the second field.
    </p>
    <p>
        Click on the settings icon to change localizations, appearance,
        typography and such options. Click on the question mark to get
        more information on cases, what they mean, when they're used
        and so on. If you get stuck you can tap on "Hint" under the input field
        to see the gender of the word or the conjucation table.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may write your answers either in normal or etymological
        orthographies, cyrillic or latin, as you wish. But please note that
        incorrect usage of the letters “z”, “c”, “s” as opposed to “ž”, “č”, “š”
        will be deemed an error. If you are having trouble inputting these
        characters, you can find a list of Windows, MacOS, and GBoard layouts
        <a href="https://interslavic.fun/resources/keyboards/">here</a>. Or you
        can use the on-screen keyboard by pressing the button in the corner.
